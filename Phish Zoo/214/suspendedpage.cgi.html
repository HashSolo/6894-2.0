	<h1>HelioHost Account Suspended</h1>
	<p>
		Ahoy! You're seeing this page because we, HelioHost, have been forced to suspend this site. This may be because:
		<ul>
			<li><h2>It has not been approved yet.</h2> New accounts must be approved before they become active. This is a one-time process, and
				usually takes less than a day after the initial registration.</li>
			<li><h2>The account was taking up too many system resources.</h2> Because HelioHost is a free webhost, we have many accounts on our
				servers. If one account is using too many resources it slows down the server for everyone. Therefore, we are careful to suspend any
				account that is using more than its fair share of CPU cycles and memory. Note that more often than not, a HelioHost account's overuse
				is caused by running cron scripts too often. Other causes include running resource-intensive scripts, such as proxy software.</li>
			<li><h2>The account has become inactive.</h2> If the control panel of a HelioHost-hosted website is not accessed for a period
				of one month, the account is declared abandoned. If you are the webmaster of the site, you can visit
				<a href="http://www.heliohost.org/scripts/renew.php" title="Reactive Expired Site">this page</a> to reactivate your site.</li>
			<li><h2>The webmaster went over their bandwidth quota.</h2> Each member at HelioHost is allotted a certain amount of bandwidth
				each month. If they go over this limit, their account will be suspended.</li>
			<li><h2>The webmaster broke the Terms of Service</h2>The <em><a href="http://www.heliohost.org/h-terms.html">Terms of Service</a></em> is a list of rules which the webmaster agrees
				to follow when signing up for an account. This list disallows, among other things, the use of this account to host pirated material,
				pornography, or illegal activities of any kind as defined by the State of Washington and the United States of America.</li>
		</ul>
